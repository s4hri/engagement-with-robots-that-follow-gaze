The data presented here is reported in Willemse et al., 2018. Please refer to that paper for context and method. We intend to upload the raw data shortly, which until then will be available upon request.

Tabs:  
HumanIntiatorRTs: the return-to-face saccades in the human initiator task in milliseconds.  
HumanResponderRTs: Target discrimination RTs in the human responder (gaze cueing) task.
